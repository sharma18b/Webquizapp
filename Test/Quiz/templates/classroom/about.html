  <h3>What's this about?</h3>
  <p>
    This Django application is an learning based Project i took up in my second year vacations (Covid) , I explored a lot of Tutorials and Documentations and Github profiles of 
    different users and tried to create a simple version of what they have already made.
    In this application, users can sign up as a student or a teacher. Teachers can create quizzes and students can answer quizzes
    based on their interests.
